Upgrade our transport to use the engine
    Create interface MovedWithEngine
        extends Movable
        Engine getEngine();

Remove engine from all Transport
    In transport that requires an engine, add MovedWithEngine to the lowest level
    (e.g. a Golf needs an engine, but so do all Volkswagens, and so do all Vehicles)

In MovedWithEngine, create a default implementation for move, which works the engine first

# Advanced version #
Different approach to engine
Change Powered<T> method getFuel() to getPowerSource()
In the lowest levels that require an engine, add "implements Powered<Engine>"

our Transport will now be powered by an Engine which is powered by fuel
